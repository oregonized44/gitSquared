<div class="moduleTitle">Git Pull</div>
            <!-- <div class="module">MODEL HERE</div> -->
            <div class="module_content"><p> We just touched base on the two commands, fetch and merge. Now that we understand how those two collaborate together we will have an easy transition into comprehending git pull...
            <br>
            <p>Simply put a git pull request is a combination of both the fetch and merge commands. It functions as one single command but adresses both the fetch and merge commands and their process (Isn't that great, you only need one single command!).</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Before:
                  <br><br> git fetch "+" git merge</li>
               <br>
              <li>Now:
                  <br><br> git pull</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Git pull is useful because it allows you to maintain current versions of your files. Where you think you may have the most up-to-date copy of a file, git pull serves to synchronize your local repository with upstream changes.</p>
